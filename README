Tom's dictionary
================
Look up words in bilingual dictionaries.

Usage
-----

Install from PyPI. ::

    pip3 install vortaro

Follow these directions to download a dictionary. ::

    python3 -m vortaro download dict.cc

Run this to confirm that you have saved the dictionary properly. ::

    python3 -m vortaro languages

Then you can look up stuff like this. ::

    python3 -m vortaro search elephant

The default is to look for the phrase in all dictionaries.
Restrict to particular languages like this. ::

    python3 -m vortaro lookup -to hr -to sv -from en elephant

Run these to see help. ::

    python3 -m vortaro
    python3 -m vortaro languages -help
    python3 -m vortaro download -help
    python3 -m vortaro index -help
    python3 -m vortaro search -help

Shell integration
-----------------
Consider setting up an alias and tab completion. Here is what I use in tcsh. ::

    alias vortaro python3 -m vortaro search
    complete vortaro 'C%*%`cut -f 1 ~/.vortaro/history`%'

Here an alias for sh. ::

    alias vortaro='python3 -m vortaro search'

Implementation
--------------
This is a Python module.
Source code is at https://thomaslevine.com/scm/vortaro/.
The command line interface uses `horetu <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/horetu/>`_.

History
-------
The idea of underlining the search term comes from
Matthias Bloch's `woerterbuch.pl <https://www1.dict.cc/download/woerterbuch.pl>`_.

woerterbuch.pl scans the whole dictionary each time a phrase is requested.
I wanted lower-latency responses, so I decided to index the dictionaries
in a special way and to cache them in memory. Version 0 used Redis as the
in-memory store.

Remarking that the queries were sort of complicated, I rewrote it in version 1
to use a relational database. It is tested only in PostgreSQL, but I suspect it
will work in others, as I think I have used only standard SQL features.

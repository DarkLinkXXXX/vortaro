Implementation
--------------
This is a Python module.
Source code is at https://thomaslevine.com/scm/dict.cc/.
The command line interface uses `horetu <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/horetu/>`_.

History
-------
I based the format of each output line on
Matthias Bloch's `woerterbuch.pl <https://www1.dict.cc/download/woerterbuch.pl>`_.
